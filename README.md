## Features:

- Encrypt Text: Convert entered text to an encrypted form by replacing vowels with specific sequences of characters.
- Decrypt Text: Convert encrypted text back to its original form by reversing vowel substitutions.

## How to Use:

1. Enter or paste your text into the input area.
2. Click the "Encrypt" button to encode the text or the "Decrypt" button to decode it.
3. The encrypted or decrypted text will be displayed in the output area.
4. You can click the "Copy" button to copy the resulting text to the clipboard.

## Next Steps:

- UI improvements for a more enjoyable user experience.
- Adding support for special characters and punctuation.
- Optimizing the encryption algorithm to make encoding more robust.
